# ImmersiveSharing
For a detailed, Please see the paper. Paper Link : **Preparing.**

I plan to provide my space dataset which is pre-made Gaussian Splats asset : **Completed. [Please see the links here.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1rA-D_rgtHcfP4HGZrl52wFrA_k-gpFRK?usp=sharing)**

## Introduction
- This repository is code for paper "Enhancing the Experience Sharing through User Attention HeatMaps and 3D Gaussian Splatting in Virtual Reality".
- It aims to enhance communication between users by constructing immersive VR spaces using 3D reconstruction and visualizing shared gaze data through heatmaps.

 ## Environment with Develop
- OpenXR & XR Interaction Toolkit
- DataBase : Firebase Realtime Database
- Unity 2022.3.7f1

 ## What Features Developed?
 [Compared to the previous project.](https://youtu.be/bYPWlAqcOMY)
- Updated gaze data collection.
- Transfer and Receive Data from FireBase RealTimeBase.
- Visualize a heatmap based on the data you've been sent.
- Gaze Reticle instead of Ray.
- Change Transparent Material.
- Add HandMenu UI

 ## Update Code.
- GazeInteractor.cs
- HeadGazeHeatMap.cs
- FireBaseHeatMapVisualization.cs
- AnimateHandOnInput.cs
- TransparentHeatMap.shader

 ## Pre-check.

- For Gaussian visualization, Clone the original `UnityGaussianProject` and Copy the package file inside it to the location where the error was found. [UnityGaussianProject](https://github.com/aras-p/UnityGaussianSplatting)

- To use the FireBase database, Get your google-services.json and Put it in StreamingAssets, and Don't forget to download the FireBase Unity SDK. [FIREBASE TUTORIAL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAa5exkTsKI&t=344s)

- If you want the Demo-like environment, Please download the Gaussian Dataset from the link above.
